      <description>As summer rounds the corner and many of us are hoping for a more adventurous time on the horizon, it is also a great time to give back to the community. In the spirit of giving, there has been a request to have a freecycle event in our community. Freecycling is about giving back to the community rather than disposing of or selling your no longer used stuff. Whether you want to participate or not, we would greatly appreciate you participating in our survey to see if this is something the community would be interested in.</description>

We want to encourage you to continue to bring forward these ideas and to work with the Board to get them approved, a seamless process.
Below is a tested-proven way to get your favorite vendor to come to Avalon:
