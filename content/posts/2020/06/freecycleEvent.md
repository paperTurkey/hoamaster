Thank you all very much for giving us feedback on your desire to have and participate in a Freecycle event in Avalon. Because of your positive response, we are going to have the Freecycle event on the morning of our next food truck event, June 25 from 8AM to 11AM.

If you are putting things out for the event, please coordinate with Cindy Peterson, as noted in the news letter. She will ensure you get a balloon at the end of your drive way to denote participation.

Any and all questions can either go directly to Cindy @ 803-414-5054 or you can use the contact us form here, on the website.

Thank you to all of our participants!
