# Food Trucks Coming in October

## ðŸŒ¸HIPPIE CHICKSðŸŒ¸ on Tuesday October 20th 5-7:30.

They strongly encourage text ahead ordering. Text ordering opens the day before the event and remains open until 1 hour before they open (so from Monday, Oct 19 through 4:30 pm on Tuesday the 20th). Please send your orders to 803-351-7492 with a name, neighborhood name and time they'd like to pick up (between 5:30-7:30). They will respond to every text order to confirm. They will still gladly accept walk up orders, but please let them know text orders take priority in their time slots, so walk ups may have a slightly longer wait time.

Keep an eye on the Facebook page for any updates as we draw closer.

## Wings and Things on Wednesday October 28th

We will have more details for you as more details come out.

Again, please say a big thank you to Stephanie Anderson for all of her hard work to bring some of the best food in Columbia to Avalon.
