# Halloween party: October 31st,  6:00pm

Wear your costumes and bring your family to our annual Halloween Party!
This year we need to follow CDC guidelines for COVID. Everyone is encouraged to wear a mask and practice social distancing. Hot dogs, drinks and snacks will be provided and will be pre-wrapped. The party will take place in Annondale Court on October 31, 6:00.


This party is only for Avalon residents and their guests. To help control attendance, bracelets will be distributed before entering Annonale Court starting at 6:00.
