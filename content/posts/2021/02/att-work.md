AT&T is planning to upgrade their existing infrastructure, running fiber wire for residential use. To do so, they will be coming into Avalon to use our easements and right of ways within our community. They will be digging and boring under driveways. They expect most homes in our neighborhood to be impacted. You will also be notified by a door hanger approximately 2-3 days prior to construction.
