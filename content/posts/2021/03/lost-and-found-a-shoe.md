Hey Neighbors,

This afternoon, your neighbor and mine, Carol Rhodes, brought me a shoe that was found on the side of the road near 129 Sandstone Rd. If this is your shoe, please feel free to reach out to me @ mat.sturdevant@gmail.com and we'll work something out. If I don't get any takers by end of month, the shoe will depart the neighborhood via our Thursday community clean-up crew (big shoutout to those awesome guys!).
